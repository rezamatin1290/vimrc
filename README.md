# Discription
you can use my vimrc config file and install c-support (optional) if you are C or C++ programmer.

# Installation
Go to vimrc directory 
```
cd vimrc
```
Change mode of installer file
```
chmod +x installer
```
Read installer help to choose your option 
```
./installer help
```
For installing c-support and vim config use *all* option 
```
./installer all
```
If you only prefer to use my vimrc run this command instead of previous option
```
./installer only-vimrc
```
If you have your own vimrc and just wanna install c-support use this option 
```
./installer only-cvim
```
